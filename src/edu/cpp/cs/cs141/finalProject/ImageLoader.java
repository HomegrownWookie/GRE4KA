/**
 * CS 141: Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving
 * Professor: Edwin Rodr&iacute;quez
 * 
 * Final Project Programming assignment
 * 
 * For this project, we as a group explored the basics of computer programming, using only simple methods and ways to properly
 * find a solution for this project. In this project, however, the goal is to have the player move about a 9 X 9 grid, consisting of
 * 9 evenly spaced rooms, one of which contains a document. IF the player finds the document hidden in these rooms, then the player wins, and wil
 * advance to the next level. Ninjas patrol the grid, moving randomly and checking if the player is around. IF the player so happens to meet with 
 * one of the ninjas, the ninja will stab the player, sending them back to the starting position and losing a life. Plaer has 3 lives.
